# Developer Portfolio
I am studying full stack web development at the University of North Carolina. I am expanding my new skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and React to find employment as a Junior Web Developer. I love the challenge that coding offers, I love collaborating with others, and I look forward to putting my new skills to use. 

## Site Breakdown
The site was built using a React backbone with Bootstrap and React Router. It is fully mobile responsive.
